This software was created to test AES implementation before we plug into the
Contiki OS (http://www.sics.se/contiki/) for a 3rd year project at UCL Computer
Science. The AES implementation itself was brought from the Internet and we added
minor feature to validate the implementation.

Therefore, this is nothing novel but we endeavoured to package AES
implementation using GNU autotools (http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/).
